# TurboWasm Architecture

## Ownership

TurboWasm owns WebAssembly-specific semantics:

```text
Wasm bytes
   -> bounded decoder
   -> validation
   -> retained typed metadata
   -> module / instance / memory / table semantics
   -> interpreter
   -> optional native backends
```

Salts remains the shared semantic/runtime foundation:

```text
CMeta
  -> stable semantic type identity and vector/mask descriptors

Salts::SIMD
  -> portable SIMD C ABI
  -> private SIMDe/native implementation

Salts::Coroutine
  -> private retained interpreter frames for backend-neutral resumable execution

CFlow / Executor
  -> optional bounded scheduling and virtual/system clocks

Salts::NativeIO
  -> optional bounded OS async-I/O progress; NativeIO request slots remain the
     operation/completion source of truth
```

TurboWasm does **not** expose SIMDe types and does not vendor a second vector
abstraction.

## Typed SIMD

The WebAssembly binary type system has one `v128` value type. TurboWasm keeps
that storage fact but refines lane semantics after opcode validation:

```text
v128 storage
  + i32x4 operation -> I32X4 semantic value
  + f32x4 operation -> F32X4 semantic value
  + i32x4.eq        -> B32X4 mask value
```

The refinement maps to canonical CMeta vector descriptors. Execution uses
`Salts::SIMD`.

This is intentionally different from making CMeta or CFlow understand Wasm
opcodes. CMeta owns vector/mask type semantics; Salts::SIMD owns portable
execution; TurboWasm owns Wasm instruction semantics.

## Execution tiers

The current execution model is:

```text
validated Wasm function
        |
        +-- cold / unsupported shape
        |       |
        |       v
        |   interpreter
        |
        '-- hot + eligible
                |
                v
          backend-neutral JIT contract
                |
                v
               MIR
          /             \
 scalar MIR lowering   SIMD helper lowering
                         |
                         v
                 private v128 slots
                         |
                         v
                    Salts::SIMD
```

Compilation is lazy and per function. An unsupported lowering shape does not
invalidate the module and does not force unrelated functions out of the JIT.

MIR remains a code-generation backend only. TurboWasm owns and preserves:

- linear-memory bounds;
- table bounds and indirect-call type checks;
- Wasm trap behavior;
- fuel/interruption checkpoints;
- call-depth and runtime state;
- host capability boundaries;
- interpreter fallback policy.

No backend is allowed to weaken these checks.

## Structured SIMD lowering

The MIR backend does not put `v128` into the public/native function ABI.
Instead, validated structured control maps values to typed merge locations:

```text
validated block / loop / if signature
        |
        +-- scalar value -> MIR register
        |
        '-- v128 value   -> canonical invocation-local slot
```

Taken branches copy SIMD values into canonical merge slots before jumping.
`br`, `br_if`, `br_table`, block/if results, loop parameters, and
`select` therefore share the same validated control signatures as the
interpreter.

Nested compiled calls save/replace/restore the private SIMD slot frame.

## Reusable compiled-artifact policy

Validated-module artifacts and compiled-function artifacts are separate layers.

```text
exact Wasm source
    -> validated artifact identity
       (source SHA-256 + feature fingerprint)
            |
            + function index
            + backend/compiler/target fingerprint
            v
        JIT cache key
            |
      +-----+------+
      |            |
     miss          hit
      |            |
 lazy compile   backend-private
      |         restore/validation
      |            |
      +-----+------+
            v
      compiled function
```

TurboWasm owns only the backend-neutral cache key, lookup/store routing and
maximum blob-size admission. It never interprets backend-native artifact bytes.
A backend restore callback must validate its private artifact format and enforce
its executable-memory/resource policy before returning a compiled handle.
Corrupt, incompatible, oversized or failed cache restores fall back to the
ordinary lazy compile path and never bypass Wasm module validation identity.

Persistent machine code is optional. The pinned MIR v1 backend deliberately
does not implement the persistence callbacks: its public API can write/read MIR
IR and generate machine code, but it does not expose a stable public
generated-machine-code plus relocation artifact import/export contract.
TurboWasm does not use MIR's underscored private code publication/dump helpers
as a persistence ABI.

## Executable-memory policy

Executable mappings are explicitly bounded.

```text
TurboWasm MIR backend
        |
        | MIR_set_code_limit(8 MiB)
        v
pinned MIR package
        |
        +-- mapping fits -> generate native code
        |
        '-- mapping exceeds limit -> MIR_gen() fails closed
                                      |
                                      v
                              interpreter fallback
```

The limit applies to the MIR context's executable mappings, not to an estimate
derived from Wasm bytecode size. The installed `TurboWasm::Runtime` interface
remains MIR-free.

## Native vector policy

The pinned MIR v1.0 IR exposes integer, floating-point, pointer, and block
register types, but no vector/v128 register type.

Therefore the supported contract is:

```text
Wasm SIMD
   -> TurboWasm private v128 slots
   -> helper calls
   -> Salts::SIMD
```

TurboWasm intentionally does not emulate a supposed native-v128 ABI with pairs
of scalar MIR registers. A future native-vector backend requires either a MIR
vector ABI or a different backend with real vector register semantics.

## Module lifetime

A `turbowasm_module` is a zero-initialized opaque owner handle. The loader
borrows immutable input bytes while private validation and retained metadata
remain implementation details behind the public handle.

A configured load may also carry a caller-owned allocator and explicit resource
limits for module bytes, individual Runtime allocations, owned linear memories
and owned tables. Module-derived instances and restartable executions inherit
that policy; imported memories/tables retain the provider instance policy.
